This Recommendation defines the transport-layer protocols and services of the SCPS protocol suite.

In fact, it will be possible to use standardized SM&C infrastructure systems to seamlessly transfer data across systems, and to adopt commercial-off-the-shelf applications for monitoring and control purposes.",

XTCE is an XML based format aim at facilitating the exchange of spacecraft telemetry and command databases between different organizations and systems during any mission phase. Such a non-proprietary format avoids the need for customized import/export tools, and the validation and new implementation of mission databases, which are often error-prone. The scope of XTCE is limited to the exchange of satellite telemetry and commanding databases. XTCE can be used to exchange a database between spacecraft manufacturers, instrument manufacturers, and different systems of the ground segment. It can also be used as an exchange mechanism between different development teams or between missions, which enhances database re-use.
